	 >>What is POM?
	 Maintaning or manaaging all the page objects in a proper way on Diffrent Files
	 is called as Page Object Module
	 
	>> why we need to use POM?
	 if i write evrything in one page i,e Identification and operational in the same class itself
	 if we have huge statements or suppose somethings are repeting multiple times we neeed to go
	 evrywhere and change if suppose tommorow some of the properties were dynamically changed
	 in that case evrytime we nee to go and change some particular statements.
	 this will keep on happens in real times.if  we take two or thre clases it will not create 
	 much issue in complex programs.
	 
	 main solution will be we can devide 
	1. Operational methods in one class
	2. Object elements Identification in other class.
